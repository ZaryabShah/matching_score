One word of warning though- I am a kinda small sized woman, size 6 pants- and this is almost tight to sit in at the hips. I absolutely would not recommend this for anyone who is heavy set. You will likely be uncomfortable. I also like to sit cross legged at the computer, and I can’t do that comfortably from this chair either.",

My only gripe with the chair is that that the backrest doesnt recline. The entire chair leans back but doesn't recline at the backrest.",
