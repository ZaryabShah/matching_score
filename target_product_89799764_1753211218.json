Already disappointed by the faulty pair, and Bose’s chosen courier which seemed intent on taking their time to return them, a call to Bose meant the replacement pair arrived sooner than they’d initially said they would and I have to say, they’re really good. I only have the QuietComfort Ultra earbuds to compare them to and whilst they’re also brilliant, the headphones are better still, being more comfortable over a few hours. The noise cancellation is superb and the modes offered can be set via the Bose app, or from one of two buttons on the right headphone. I’m not the most technical of people, so the simplicity of a mode button, a Bluetooth button, and a volume sensor which works by sliding your finger against it works for me. When I answered a phone call on them yesterday we could hear one another without any unwanted background noise, and I wandered around the house with my phone charging in a cradle several rooms away without the signal being interrupted (just remember to set the call auto answer function to off so it doesn’t automatically answer spam callers telling you about a crash you didn’t have). They fold away neatly into a smart case which has a pocket to stash away a connecting and a charging cable, and the charge holds for quite a while. After sending back the first pair I expected these to be just as poor and promised myself if I was sent a request to review them the bad pair would earn these just one star, but they’re not, they’re brilliant and I’m impressed with them. Five stars all round.",

The controls are the best I've seen, the noise-cancelling is unrivalled, the sound quality is as good as a pair of noise-cancelling headphones can get. The sound stage and sound profile is, coming from an ex Sennheiser in-ear user, very wide and crystal clear. The track separation is INCREDIBLE. Listening to greatly mixed songs on this is a bliss. My only critisism would be the lack of base aptX codec. It has aptX adaptive and Qualcomm sound certification etc.. but Samsung phones only have base aptX for some reason, and these currently run on AAC on my phone. Bose, please fix!",
