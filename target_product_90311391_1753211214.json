First Impressions were amazing; straight out of the box they are amazing the spatial awareness was impressive and they work great for phone calls. Though majority of my headphone use is active use. As in working out, biking, or working outside. Once I started to move these slip out of my ears. They required constant adjusting when running it seemed every 100 yards I would have to reposition them. When performing weightlifting I had to turn all the smart features off as they kept pausing my music. While performing simple things like pushups they would fall out. Not to mention while sitting at my desk at work the left ear bud would skip for about 3 seconds every minute which was driving me up a wall. I really wanted they ear buds to work as they reminded me of my old galaxy buds I used to love but these are not made for active lifestyles. If you are using them for wearing in the office or for flying on plane, I believe they will work fine but if you find yourself using them in active scenarios I recommend to keep looking.",

Con 1: They only come with foam tips, these tips irretate my ears skin, Had to switch, so I use the silicone tips from the XM3 earbuds, cause they don´t irritate my skin so sadly I have less noice canceling. Con 2: When i put them in the case there is no indicator for each earbud, so sometimes one charges while the other does not. Con 3: Compared to some other earbuds the 8 hour playtime is not the longest. while others can last up to and beyond 18 hours. Pro 1: They have ambient sound, And the noice canceling is good. (Altough I don´t get the best noice canceling cause of the foam.) Pro 2: Comfortable in the ears and don´t stick out too much, so they stay inn without falling out while running. Pro 3: They have very good sound quality, when listening to music and phonecalls. Pro 4: Fast charging times when the earbuds are inn the case.",
